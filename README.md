# SteamworksForPython
Howdy!  This is a branch of Easimer's SteamworksForPython in an attempt to bring a fully-functional Python module for Steam out for the public.

Feel free to fork or contribute to this module.

# How To
While I am still tinkering away with this, here are some things to note:

- You will need the Steamworks SDK
- You will most likely need a Steamworks account, with a valid AppID; you might be able to test against existing game's AppID's though
